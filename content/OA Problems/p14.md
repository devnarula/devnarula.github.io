The NLP enthusiasts of Hackerland are working on a string transformation algorithm. In a single operation, a string `s` can be transformed into another string by removing a suffix of the string and adding the removed suffix in front of the remaining string. For example, the string "abcd" can be transformed to "dabc" by removing the suffix "d" and adding it to the front of the remaining string "abc".

Given two strings `src` and `target` of lowercase English characters and an integer `k`, find the number of ways to transform the string `src` to the string `target` using the given algorithm in exactly `k` steps. Since the answer can be large, report it modulo $10^9 + 7$.

**Note:** Two ways are considered different if the sequence of indices chosen for breaking the suffix is different at 1 or more steps.

## Function Description

Complete the function `getNumWays` in the editor below.

`getNumWays` has the following parameter(s):
- `string src`: the source string
- `string target`: the target string
- `int k`: the number of steps

**Returns:**
- `int`: the number of ways modulo $10^9 + 7$

## Example 1:

**Input:**

```plainview
src = "ababab", target = "ababab", k = 1
```
**Output:**
```plainview
2
```

**Explanation:**

Choose the suffixes "abab" and "ab" to transform `src` to `target` in a single operation.

## Example 2:

**Input:**

```plainview
src = "aaaa", target = "aaaa", k = 2
```
**Output:**
```plainview
9
```

**Explanation:**

All sequences of operations convert `src` to the `target`.

## Constraints:

- $2 \leq \text{length(src)} \leq 1000$
- $2 \leq \text{length(target)} \leq 1000$
- $1 \leq k \leq 10^6$
