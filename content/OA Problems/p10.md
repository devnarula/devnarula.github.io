title: Smallest Set Covering Intervals

Given a series of integer intervals, determine the size of the smallest set that contains at least 2 integers within each interval.

## Function Description

Complete the function `interval` in the editor below.

`interval` has the following parameters:
- `int first[n]`: each element represents the start of interval $i$
- `int last[n]`: each element represents the end of interval $i$

**Returns:**
- `int`: the size of the smallest interval possible

## Example

**Input:**
```plainview
first = [0, 1, 2]
last = [2, 3, 3]
```
**Output:**
```plainview
3
```

**Explanation:**

The intervals start at `first[i]` and end at `last[i]`.

Both intervals 0 and 1 contain 1 and 2. These are the only two integers that interval 0 shares, so both integers must be included in the answer set. Both intervals 1 and 2 contain 2 and 3. These are the only two values that interval 2 shares. The smallest set that contains at least 2 integers from each interval is {1, 2, 3}.

## Constraints

- $1 \leq n \leq 10^5$
- $0 \leq \text{first}[i] \leq \text{last}[i] \leq 10^9$
