title: Minimum Flips
---
Start with an initial string of zeros. Choose any digit to flip. When a digit is flipped, its value and those to the right switch state between 0 and 1. Given a target string of binary digits, determine the minimum number of flips required to achieve the target.

**Example:**

target = 01011

Start with a string of 5 zeros, the same length string as the target.
```plainview
Initial String -> 00000
Flip the 3rd digit -> 00111
Flip the 2nd digit -> 01000
Flip the 4th digit -> 01011
```

3 flips are required to reach the target. The return value is 3.

## Function Description

Complete the function `minimumFlips` in the editor below.

`minimumFlips` has the following parameter(s):
- `string target`: a string of 0s and 1s to match

**Returns:**
- `int`: the minimum number of flips needed to obtain the target string

## Constraints
- $1 \leq \text{length of target} \leq 10^5$
- $0 \leq \text{target}[i] \leq 1$
- The target string consists of digits 0 and 1

## Input Format For Custom Testing

### Sample Case 0

**Sample Input For Custom Testing**

0011 -> target = '0011'


**Sample Output**

1

**Explanation**

The number of digits is $\text{length(target)} = 4$. Flip the 3rd digit to obtain the desired state: `0000 -> 0011` after 1 flip.
