A network security administrator must protect networks at a number of locations from cyber-attacks. Initially, the $i^{th}$ network has `num_server[i]` servers, and `money[i]` funds allocated for security upgrades. To upgrade a server in the $i^{th}$ network, it costs `upgrade[i]`. Selling a server adds `sell[i]` to available funds.

Given the arrays `num_servers`, `money`, `upgrade`, and `sell`, each with $n$ integers, determine the maximum number of servers that can be upgraded to ensure optimal network security. The result should be an array of $n$ integers, where the $i^{th}$ integer represents the maximum number of upgraded servers for the $i^{th}$ network system.

### Example

Given, `num_servers = [4, 3]`, `money = [8, 9]`, `sell = [4, 2]` and `upgrade = [4, 5]`

| System | Description                                                                                                            | Number of upgraded servers |
|--------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| 1st    | A server can be sold at a cost of 4 and upgraded at a cost of 4. If one server is sold, the total amount left is 8 + 4 = 12 and 3 servers will be left. Now each server can be upgraded at a cost of 4 for each | There can be 3 upgraded servers |
| 2nd    | One server can be sold for a cost of 2 amounting to total money of 11 units which can be used to upgrade both of the remaining servers at a cost of 10 units | There can be 2 upgraded servers |

Hence the answer is `[3, 2]`.

## Function Description

Complete the `getMaxUpgradedServers` in the editor below.

`getMaxUpgradedServers` has the following parameter(s):
- `int num_servers[n]`: an array of integers
- `int money[n]`: an array of integers
- `int upgrade[n]`: an array of integers
- `int sell[n]`: an array of integers

**Returns:**
- `int[n]`: an array of integers where the $i^{th}$ integer represents the maximum number of upgraded servers for the $i^{th}$ network system

## Constraints
- $1 \leq n \leq 10^4$
- $1 \leq num\_servers[i], money[i], sell[i], upgrade[i] \leq 10^4$

## Input Format For Custom Testing

### Sample Case 0

**Sample Input For Custom Testing**
```plainview
1  -> num_servers[] size n = 1
12 -> num_servers = [12]
1  -> money[] size n = 1
12 -> money = [12]
1  -> sell[] size n = 1
2  -> sell = [2]
1  -> upgrade[] size n = 1
2  -> upgrade = [2]
```
**Sample Output**
```plainview
4
2
```

**Explanation**

For the first system, it is optimal to sell 2 servers to get a total amount of 4 + 6 = 10 units of money which can be used to upgrade the remaining 4 servers.

For the second system, it is optimal to sell 1 server to get a total amount of 2 + 2 = 4 units of money which can be used to upgrade the remaining 2 servers.
### Sample Case 1

**Sample Input For Custom Testing**

```plainview
2 -> num_servers[] size n = 2
6 -> num_servers = [6, 3]
2 -> money[] size n = 2
4 -> money = [4, 2]
2 -> sell[] size n = 2
3 -> sell = [3, 2]
2 -> upgrade[] size n = 2
2 -> upgrade = [2, 2]
```

**Sample Output**
```plainview
4
2
```


**Explanation**

For the first system, it is optimal to sell 2 servers to get a total amount of 4 + 6 = 10 units of money which can be used to upgrade the remaining 4 servers.

For the second system, it is optimal to sell 1 server to get a total amount of 2 + 2 = 4 units of money which can be used to upgrade the remaining 2 servers.
