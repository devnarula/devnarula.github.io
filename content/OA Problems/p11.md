title: Unequal Elements

A test needs to be prepared on the HackerRank platform with questions from different sets of skills to assess candidates. Given an array, `skills`, of size `n`, where `skills[i]` denotes the skill type of the $i^{th}$ question, select skills for the questions on the test. The skills should be grouped together as much as possible. The goal is to find the maximum length of a subsequence of `skills` such that there are no more than `k` unequal adjacent elements in the subsequence. Formally, find a subsequence of `skills`, call it `x`, of length `m` such that there are at most `k` indices where $x[i] \neq x[i+1]$ for all $0 \leq i < m$.

## Function Description

Complete the function `findMaxLength` in the editor below.

`findMaxLength` has the following parameters:
- `int skills[n]`: the different skill types
- `int k`: the maximum count of unequal adjacent elements

**Returns:**
- `int`: the maximum value of `m`

## Example

**Input:**
```plainview
skills = [1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1], k = 2
```

**Output:**
```plainview
5
```

**Explanation:**

The longest possible subsequence is $x = [1, 1, 2, 2, 1]$. There are only two indices where $x[1] \neq x[2]$ and $x[3] \neq x[4]$. Return its length, 5.

## Constraints

- $1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^3$
- $1 \leq k < n$
- $1 \leq skills[i] \leq 2 \times 10^3$
