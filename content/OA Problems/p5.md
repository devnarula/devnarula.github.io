title: Snowflake Efficient Deployments

A supercomputer has several processors to deploy for execution. They are arranged sequentially in a row from `1` to `n`. The efficiency of each processor depends upon the order of deployment of its adjacent processors.

For the $i^{th}$ processor, the efficiency of the $i^{th}$ processor is `no_adjacent[i]`, `one_adjacent[i]`, or `both_adjacent[i]` when neither, one, or both adjacent processors is deployed before processor $i$.

Note: The $1^{st}$ and $n^{th}$ processors can only have one adjacent.

Find the maximum possible sum of efficiencies amongst all possible orders of deployment.

## Function Description

Complete the function `maxEfficiency` in the editor.

`maxEfficiency` has the following parameters:
- `int noAdjacent[n]`: an array of integers
- `int oneAdjacent[n]`: an array of integers
- `int bothAdjacent[n]`: an array of integers

**Returns:**
- `long`: the maximum possible sum of efficiencies

## Examples

### Example 1

**Input:**
```plainview
noAdjacent = [1, 2, 3, 4]
oneAdjacent = [4, 4, 2, 1]
bothAdjacent = [0, 1, 1, 0]
```
**Output:**
```plainview
13
```

**Explanation:**

Consider the following orders of deployment (1-based indexing):

- The deployment sequence is {1 → 3 → 4 → 2}. Then, the sum of efficiencies = no_adjacent[1] + no_adjacent[3] + one_adjacent[4] + both_adjacent[2] = 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 6.
- Let the deployment sequence be {4 → 2 → 1 → 3}, no_adjacent[4] + no_adjacent[2] + one_adjacent[1] + both_adjacent[3] = 4 + 2 + 4 + 1 = 11.
- Let the deployment sequence be {4 → 3 → 2 → 1}, one_adjacent[3] + one_adjacent[2] + 2 + 2 + 4 + 1 = 7.

Amongst all possible deployments, the maximum possible sum of efficiencies is 13.

### Example 2

**Input:**
```plainview
noAdjacent = [2, 1, 3]
oneAdjacent = [4, 2, 1]
bothAdjacent = [1, 2, 3]
```
**Output:**
```plainview
9
```

**Explanation:**

Several ways to deploy processors are:

- Let the deployment sequence be {1 → 2 → 3}. The sum of efficiencies = no_adjacent[1] + one_adjacent[2] + 2 + 1 = 5.
- {1 → 3 → 2}, no_adjacent[1] + no_adjacent[3] + both_adjacent[2] = 2 + 3 + 2 = 7.
- {2 → 1 → 3}, no_adjacent[2] + one_adjacent[1] + 4 + 1 = 6.
- {2 → 3 → 1}, no_adjacent[2] + one_adjacent[3] + 1 + 4 = 6.
- {3 → 2 → 1}, no_adjacent[3] + one_adjacent[2] + 2 + 4 = 9.
- {3 → 1 → 2}, no_adjacent[3] + no_adjacent[1] + both_adjacent[2] = 3 + 2 + 2 = 7.

### Example 3

**Input:**
```plainview
noAdjacent = [1, 6]
oneAdjacent = [2, 3]
bothAdjacent = [3, 2]
```


**Output:**
```plainview
8
```

**Explanation:**

Some ways to deploy processors are:

- Let the deployment sequence be {1 → 2}. Then, sum of efficiencies = no_adjacent[1] + 3 = 4.
- {2 → 1}, no_adjacent[2] + 2 = 8.

## Constraints

- $1 \leq n \leq 10^5$
- $1 \leq \text{no\_adjacent}[i], \text{one\_adjacent}[i], \text{both\_adjacent}[i] \leq 10^9$
