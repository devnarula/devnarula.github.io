An airport limousine can take multiple riders to the airport at the same time. On the way back to the starting point, the driver may pick up additional riders for the next trip to the airport. A map of rider locations has been created, represented as a square matrix.

The matrix is filled with cells, and each cell will have an initial value as follows:

- A value $\geq 0$ represents a path.
- A value of 1 represents a rider.
- A value of -1 represents an obstruction.

The rules of motion are as follows:

- The driver starts at $(0,0)$ and the airport is at $(n-1,n-1)$. Movement toward the airport is right $(\rightarrow)$ or down $(\downarrow)$ through valid path cells.
- After reaching $(n-1,n-1)$, the driver travels back to $(0,0)$ by moving left $(\leftarrow)$ or up $(\uparrow)$ through valid path cells.
- When passing through a path cell containing a rider, the rider is picked up. Once picked up, the cell becomes an empty path cell.
- If there is no valid path between $(0,0)$ and $(n-1,n-1)$, then no riders can be collected.
- The ultimate goal is to collect as many riders as possible.

## Example

**Input:**
```plainview
n = 4
mat = [
[0, 0, 0, 1],
[1, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0]
]
```

**Output:**
```plainview
2
```

**Explanation:**

The driver can collect a maximum of 2 riders by taking the following path:

```plainview
(0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3) → (3,2) → (3,1) → (3,0) → (2,0) → (1,0) → (0,0)
```

**Input:**

```plainview
n = 3
mat = [
[0, 1, -1],
[1, 0, -1],
[1, 1, 1]
]
```

**Output:**

```plainview
5
```

**Explanation:**

The driver can collect a maximum of 5 riders by taking the following path:
```plainview
(0,0) → (0,1) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (2,1) → (2,0) → (1,0) → (0,0)
```

## Constraints

- $1 \leq n \leq 100$
- The matrix cells contain values as described above.
